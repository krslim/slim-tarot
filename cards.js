        "love": "In love, this can be a new connection, a reset, or a chance to approach a relationship with fewer rules and more honesty. If single, say yes to opportunities; if partnered, try something that brings playfulness back.",
        "career": "A new role, a new direction, or a ‘try it and see’ phase. You don’t need the whole map yet—just a sincere first move. Watch for naive assumptions, but don’t over-plan yourself into paralysis.",

        "love": "Mixed signals or a ‘situationship’ that lacks clarity. Either someone isn’t ready, or the connection needs boundaries. If you feel swept along, ask direct questions and watch the answers.",
        "career": "A risk taken without a plan, or an opportunity you’re not taking seriously. Tighten basics: deadlines, money, agreements. If you’re stuck, pick one small action to regain momentum.",
        "health": "Overdoing it, ignoring warning signs, or looking for a quick fix. Choose steady over dramatic. Spiritually, come back to grounding practices and keep promises you make to yourself."

        "love": "Chemistry and initiative. Someone may be ready to make a clear move, communicate directly, or define what they want. Watch for charm that is backed by consistency.",
        "career": "Strong for interviews, pitching, building, and shipping. This is ‘show your work’ energy: take ownership, demonstrate competence, and turn ideas into something people can touch.",

        "love": "Charm without follow-through, or communication that feels performative. Ask: do actions match words? If you’re the one performing, be honest about what you can actually offer.",
        "career": "Beware of overpromising. Tighten scope, document decisions, and avoid ‘magic thinking’ in timelines. If something feels too slick, request specifics.",

        "love": "A strong card for emotional subtlety—reading between the lines, feeling what isn’t said. Attraction may be private or developing slowly. If you feel confusion, ask for clarity gently; don’t interrogate what needs tenderness.",
        "career": "Research, strategy, and discretion. This can be a “watch and learn” phase, where you gather intelligence before making a move. Trust your instincts about office dynamics and keep confidences.",

        "love": "Mixed messages, emotional withholding, or assumptions replacing honest talk. If you’re tempted to test or spy, that’s a signal to address insecurity directly. If someone stays opaque, decide what boundaries you need.",
        "career": "Misread signals, politics, or information gaps. Avoid acting on rumor. Ask for specifics, document decisions, and do your due diligence before committing.",

        "love": "Caretaking dynamics, insecurity about worth, or affection used to manage anxiety. If you’re overfunctioning, step back and see what happens. Love should feed you too.",
        "career": "Burnout risk from trying to do everything yourself. Improve systems, delegate, and simplify. If a project isn’t growing, check the basics: time, money, support, and clarity.",

        "love": "A relationship can become a hierarchy. Watch for emotional coldness, ultimatums, or “my way or else.” Healthy leadership in love looks like reliability plus respect.",
        "career": "Micromanagement, bureaucracy, or conflicts with authority. Re-check agreements, roles, and decision rights. If you’re leading, invite feedback and loosen unnecessary constraints.",
