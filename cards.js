        "subtitle": "New beginnings, innocence, spontaneity, a leap of faith",
        "general": "The Fool stands at the threshold of a journey, a small bag slung over one shoulder carrying only the essentials of past experience, a white rose in hand symbolising purity of intention. The cliff edge ahead represents the unknown, yet the figure steps forward with eyes lifted toward the bright sun—divine guidance and infinite potential. This is card zero: not emptiness, but all possibilities contained in a single moment. The Fool asks you to trust the universe enough to take the first step, even when the path isn't visible. There is wisdom in beginning again with open eyes and an unburdened heart. The small dog at your heels is both companion and warning—instinct will guide you, but stay present. This is not recklessness; it is faith in motion.",
        "love": "The Fool in love is the spark before the flame catches—a new connection filled with possibility, or an existing relationship rediscovering playfulness and wonder. If you're single, this card encourages you to say yes to unexpected invitations and approach dating with curiosity rather than a checklist. There's something refreshing about not knowing where things will lead. For those partnered, The Fool invites you to release old patterns and assumptions about each other. Try something spontaneous together: a trip with no itinerary, a conversation without defensiveness, a gesture of affection without expectation. The white rose reminds you that love thrives on sincerity, not strategy. Trust the feeling, not the forecast.",
        "career": "Professionally, The Fool marks the start of something new—a role, a project, a direction you've been curious about but hesitant to pursue. You don't need every credential or a five-year plan. What you need is willingness. This card often appears when someone is considering a career shift, starting a business, or returning to study later in life. The universe is asking: what would you try if you knew you couldn't fail? That said, The Fool's bag contains *some* supplies—bring what you've learned, but don't let past disappointments weigh you down. Say yes to the opportunity that makes your heart race slightly. Imposter syndrome is normal; courage is acting anyway. Document your journey as you go—you'll want to remember this beginning.",
        "health": "The Fool supports fresh starts in wellness: the first day of a new routine, committing to walk daily, trying a form of movement you've never considered, or simply deciding to treat your body with more kindness. This isn't about dramatic transformation—it's about showing up with beginner's mind. The bright sun overhead suggests vitamin D, outdoor time, and activities that lift your spirits. Spiritually, The Fool is permission to explore without committing to a single path. Meditate, journal, walk in nature, try a class. Stay light. Your body knows how to heal when you stop forcing outcomes. The dog beside you is your intuition—notice what feels expansive versus what feels constricting. Start small, stay curious, let joy be your guide."

      "reversed": {
        "subtitle": "Recklessness, risk-taking, naivety, holding back, fear of change",
        "general": "Reversed, The Fool's energy splits in two directions: either you're stepping forward without looking, or you're frozen at the cliff's edge, refusing to move at all. The first warns of impulsivity—making decisions based on escape rather than inspiration, ignoring practical concerns, or trusting the wrong people because you want to believe. The small bag is empty now; you've left wisdom behind. The second warns of the opposite trap: overthinking, waiting for perfect conditions, or letting fear of looking foolish keep you stuck. The dog barks louder here—your instincts are trying to tell you something. Pause. Ask: am I being reckless, or am I hiding behind caution? The middle path is conscious risk: acknowledging uncertainty while taking responsibility for outcomes. The sun still shines; you've just turned away from it.",
        "love": "In relationships, reversed Fool energy shows up as either too little boundaries or too much walls. You might be ignoring red flags because the chemistry feels exciting, jumping into something before you're ready, or attracting partners who are emotionally unavailable and calling it 'keeping things light.' Alternatively, you may be so guarded that nothing new can enter—past hurts have made you cynical, and you're mistaking protection for wisdom. If you're partnered, there may be avoidance of important conversations or a pattern of creating drama to avoid intimacy. The reversal asks: where are you being naive, and where are you being unnecessarily fearful? Clarity is kinder than games. If something feels unstable, name it. If you're ready for more, say so.",
        "career": "Career-wise, watch for two patterns: leaping without a net, or refusing to leap at all. The first looks like quitting without savings, making promises you can't keep, or trusting verbal agreements that should be written. The universe supports boldness, not foolishness. Get the details in order. The second pattern is paralysis—staying in a role that drains you because the unknown feels scarier than the familiar misery. You're waiting for certainty that will never come. Between these extremes is wise action: update your CV, save three months of expenses, have honest conversations, test the waters before diving. If you're being asked to take on risk at work, ensure the rewards match. Don't let anyone romanticise instability as 'growth.'",
        "health": "Reversed, The Fool can indicate health choices made from desperation rather than discernment—extreme diets, unproven supplements, or ignoring medical advice in favour of quick fixes. Alternatively, you may know what you need to do but keep postponing it, telling yourself you'll start 'when things settle down.' The cliff edge hasn't moved; you're just pacing in place. Your body is asking for consistency, not perfection. Start with one non-negotiable: sleep at a regular time, drink water, move for ten minutes daily. Spiritually, you may be chasing every new practice without deepening any of them, or refusing to explore because it feels 'woo-woo.' Meet yourself in the middle. Ground first, then expand. The dog is still with you—listen when something feels off, even if you can't explain why."

      "upright": {
        "subtitle": "Manifestation, resourcefulness, power, inspired action",
        "general": "The Magician stands with one hand raised toward heaven, the other pointing to earth—'as above, so below.' Before him on the table lie the four suits of the tarot: wand, cup, sword, and pentacle. He has all the tools. The infinity symbol floats above his head; the ouroboros belt circles his waist. This is card number one: the first active step after The Fool's leap. The Magician doesn't create from nothing—he channels what already exists, directing energy with intention and skill. You have everything you need. The question is whether you'll use it. This is a time of competence, clarity, and the confidence that comes from knowing you can affect your reality. Speak your truth. Take the action. Make it real.",
        "love": "The Magician in love is someone who knows what they want and isn't afraid to pursue it. If you're single, this card suggests putting yourself out there with authenticity—your charm is magnetic right now, but it's your sincerity that will draw the right person. For those in relationships, this is a card of conscious creation: you can improve what you have through communication, effort, and presence. Stop waiting for your partner to read your mind. Say what you need. Plan the date. Initiate the conversation. The Magician reminds you that love is a verb. You have the tools to build something beautiful—use them with integrity, not manipulation.",
        "career": "This is one of the strongest career cards in the deck. The Magician says: you have the skills, the opportunity, and the timing. Now execute. Present the idea. Launch the project. Ask for the promotion. This card favours entrepreneurs, creatives, communicators, and anyone whose work involves turning vision into reality. Your ability to synthesise information and present it clearly is heightened. Networking works. Learning new skills sticks. Just remember: the Magician's power comes from alignment, not force. Don't oversell. Don't manipulate. Let your genuine competence speak. Document your wins—they'll matter later.",
        "health": "The Magician supports mind-body connection work: meditation, breathwork, yoga, or practices that unite intention with physical action. This is an excellent time to start a fitness routine because you'll have the mental discipline to follow through. The card also suggests that your thoughts are shaping your physical state more than usual—positive self-talk and visualisation can support healing. If you've been researching a health concern, now is the time to consult a professional and take action. Spiritually, you're in a phase of active practice rather than passive learning. Teach what you know. Share your gifts. The universe flows through you when you stay humble and focused."
      },
      "reversed": {
        "subtitle": "Manipulation, poor planning, untapped talents, illusion",
        "general": "Reversed, the Magician's gifts become distorted. The tools are still on the table, but you're either misusing them or refusing to pick them up. This can show up as manipulation—using charm or intelligence to control outcomes rather than create them. It can also appear as imposter syndrome: you have everything you need, but you don't believe it. Watch for procrastination disguised as preparation, or confidence that's all performance with no substance. The infinity symbol becomes a loop you can't escape. Ask yourself: am I being honest about my intentions? Am I taking action, or just talking about it? The Magician reversed asks you to ground your power in integrity. Stop performing. Start doing.",
        "love": "In love, the reversed Magician can indicate someone who is charming but inconsistent—words don't match actions. This could be you or your partner. There may be game-playing, withholding, or a relationship that feels more like negotiation than connection. If you're single, beware of projecting qualities onto someone you barely know. The chemistry is real, but is the character? For those partnered, stop trying to 'fix' your partner through cleverness. Have the honest conversation. If you've been manipulating situations to get your needs met, try direct communication instead. Love thrives on authenticity, not strategy.",
        "career": "Career-wise, this reversal warns against overpromising and underdelivering. You may be tempted to exaggerate your skills or commit to timelines you can't meet. Don't. The short-term gain isn't worth the long-term reputation damage. Alternatively, you may be holding back—afraid to show your work, hesitant to claim credit, waiting for permission that will never come. Your talents are real. Use them. If you're feeling stuck, break projects into smaller steps and complete them one at a time. Momentum builds confidence. Also watch for office politics: someone may be presenting themselves more favourably than reality supports. Verify before you trust.",
        "health": "Reversed, the Magician can indicate health approaches that are all theory and no practice—you've researched extensively but haven't changed anything. Or you're trying to 'hack' your health with shortcuts rather than building sustainable habits. There's also a warning about placebos and false promises: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Work with qualified professionals. Follow through on what you start. Spiritually, you may be using practices to escape rather than engage—meditation to avoid feelings, spirituality to bypass responsibility. True power comes from integration, not avoidance. Ground yourself. Be honest. Do the work."

      "upright": {
        "subtitle": "Intuition, sacred knowledge, divine feminine, the subconscious mind",
        "general": "The High Priestess sits between two pillars—one black, one white—guarding the veil between the conscious and unconscious mind. Behind her hangs a tapestry depicting palms and pomegranates, symbols of fertility and hidden wisdom. At her feet rests the crescent moon; in her lap, the scroll of divine law, partially concealed. She does not speak; she waits. The High Priestess is card number two: the first receptive card, the complement to The Magician's action. She represents knowledge that comes not from study but from sensing, not from proving but from knowing. Your intuition is heightened now. Dreams may be vivid. Pay attention to what you feel but cannot explain. The answers you seek are already within you—quiet yourself enough to hear them.",
        "love": "In matters of the heart, the High Priestess asks you to listen to what isn't being said. There is depth here—emotional undercurrents, unspoken attraction, or a connection that operates on a soul level. If you're single, you may meet someone through a dream, a synchronicity, or in a quiet moment when you're not looking. Don't force it. For those partnered, this card invites you to create space for vulnerability and silence together. Not every feeling needs to be analysed immediately. Some things reveal themselves in stillness. If something feels off in your relationship, trust that feeling even if you can't articulate why. Your body knows before your mind catches up.",
        "career": "Professionally, the High Priestess favours research, strategy, and behind-the-scenes work. This is not a time to push aggressively forward; it's a time to gather information, observe patterns, and trust your instincts about office dynamics. You may notice things others miss—pay attention. This card also supports creative and intuitive work: writing, psychology, healing arts, or any field that requires deep listening. If you're considering a career move, wait for clarity rather than forcing a decision. The right opportunity will feel different—it will resonate in your body, not just look good on paper. Keep confidences. Not everything needs to be shared.",
        "health": "The High Priestess governs cycles—menstrual, lunar, seasonal. Honour your body's rhythms rather than fighting them. Rest when you need to rest; move when energy flows. This card also suggests that stress may be manifesting as physical symptoms—your body is speaking a language you've been ignoring. Journal, meditate, spend time near water. Pay attention to dreams; they may contain information about your wellbeing. Spiritually, this is a time to deepen your inner practice. You don't need more information; you need more silence. The wisdom you seek is already within you. Trust the quiet voice."
      },
      "reversed": {
        "subtitle": "Repressed intuition, secrets, disconnection from self, surface-level thinking",
        "general": "Reversed, the High Priestess indicates a disconnect from your inner knowing. You may be ignoring clear intuitive signals, overthinking what should be felt, or drowning out your inner voice with noise and distraction. Alternatively, this card can warn of secrets—things hidden from you or things you're hiding from yourself. There may be information you need that isn't available yet; patience is required. The reversed High Priestess asks: what are you refusing to feel? What truth are you avoiding? The pillars still stand; you've just turned away from the veil. Reconnect through solitude, silence, and honest self-inquiry. Your intuition hasn't left—you've stopped listening.",
        "love": "In love, this reversal can indicate emotional unavailability—yours or your partner's. There may be things left unsaid that are creating distance, or you're intellectualising feelings rather than experiencing them. If you're single, you might be attracted to people who are mysterious in unhealthy ways—unavailable, secretive, or emotionally withholding. Ask direct questions. Watch for actions, not just words. For those partnered, create space for honest conversation. If you've been sensing something is off, address it gently but directly. Secrets erode trust. The High Priestess reversed asks you to bring what's hidden into the light—not to punish, but to heal.",
        "career": "Career-wise, the reversed High Priestess warns against making decisions based on incomplete information. You may be missing key details, misreading office politics, or trusting your gut when you should be verifying facts. Alternatively, you may know something important but are afraid to speak up. If you're sensing dysfunction or unethical behaviour, document what you observe and protect yourself. This is also a warning against gossip and rumours—verify before you act. If you're feeling disconnected from your work, ask yourself what you're avoiding. Sometimes the issue isn't the job; it's that you've lost touch with what matters to you.",
        "health": "Reversed, this card can indicate ignoring your body's signals—pushing through fatigue, dismissing symptoms, or using busyness to avoid dealing with health concerns. Stress may be manifesting as anxiety, insomnia, or digestive issues. Slow down. Your body is trying to communicate. There's also a warning against self-diagnosis or relying on internet research instead of professional care. Get the checkup. Ask the question. Listen to qualified advice. Spiritually, you may be using spiritual practices to escape rather than engage—avoiding difficult emotions by staying 'zen.' True spiritual maturity includes facing what's uncomfortable. Feel your feelings. They're not enemies; they're messengers."

        "general": "The Empress sits in a lush garden, surrounded by growth and abundance. Wheat grows at her feet; a heart-shaped shield bearing Venus's symbol rests beside her. She wears a crown of twelve stars and a flowing gown, pregnant with possibility. The Empress is card number three: the first card of manifestation after the dualities of Priestess and Magician. She represents the fertile earth itself—what you nurture will grow. This is a time of creativity, sensuality, and receiving. You don't have to earn love or abundance; you are worthy by nature. Allow yourself to be cared for. Create something beautiful. Connect with nature. The Empress reminds you that rest is productive, pleasure is purposeful, and caring for yourself is not selfish—it's essential.",
        "love": "The Empress in love is warmth, affection, and deep emotional nourishment. If you're single, you're radiating an energy that draws others to you—embody what you seek. Be the partner you want to attract: kind, present, generous with affection. For those in relationships, this card suggests a phase of deepening intimacy, possibly moving toward commitment, cohabitation, or family planning. There's a sensuality here that goes beyond the physical—it's about creating a relationship that feels like home. Give and receive freely. Express appreciation. Make your space beautiful together. The Empress asks: are you nurturing this connection, or taking it for granted?",
        "career": "Professionally, the Empress favours creative projects, building something with lasting value, and work that helps others flourish. This is an excellent time for entrepreneurs, artists, caregivers, and anyone whose work involves creation or nurturing. Collaboration thrives now—people want to contribute to something meaningful. Focus on quality over speed. Invest in relationships with colleagues and clients; these connections will bear fruit. If you've been waiting to launch a creative project, the timing is favourable. Trust your aesthetic sense. Make it beautiful. The Empress also reminds you to create a work environment that supports your wellbeing—plants, natural light, comfort matter.",
        "health": "The Empress governs the body's capacity for pleasure and rest. This card supports recovery, gentle movement, and nourishing your body with whole foods and adequate sleep. It's also a reminder that stress management isn't optional—it's foundational. Spend time in nature. Eat meals without rushing. Prioritise activities that bring you joy. For those dealing with hormonal issues, reproductive health, or body image concerns, the Empress invites you to make peace with your physical form. Your body is not a project to be fixed; it's a home to be honoured. Spiritually, connect with the earth itself—walk barefoot, garden, sit under trees. You are held."

      "reversed": {
        "subtitle": "Creative blocks, dependence on others, neglecting self-care, smothering",
        "general": "Reversed, the Empress's nurturing energy becomes imbalanced. You may be overgiving—pouring into others while depleting yourself—or you may be unable to receive, pushing away care and insisting on handling everything alone. Creative blocks often appear with this reversal: you want to create, but something feels stuck. The garden is overgrown; the wheat is untended. Ask yourself: where am I neglecting my own needs? Where am I trying to control growth instead of allowing it? The Empress reversed asks you to rebalance. Set boundaries around your energy. Accept help. Create for yourself, not for approval. Abundance flows when you stop forcing it.",
        "love": "In relationships, the reversed Empress can indicate codependency—caring for your partner to the point of losing yourself, or expecting your partner to be your sole source of emotional nourishment. There may be insecurity manifesting as clinginess or jealousy. Alternatively, you might be withholding affection as a form of control. If you're single, you may be waiting for someone to 'complete' you rather than cultivating wholeness within. The Empress reversed asks: are you nurturing this relationship, or suffocating it? Love requires space to breathe. Give freely, but maintain your own garden. You cannot pour from an empty cup.",
        "career": "Career-wise, this reversal warns of burnout from overgiving—taking on too much, helping everyone else while your own projects stagnate. You may also be experiencing creative block, waiting for inspiration instead of creating conditions that allow it to flow. Simplify. Delegate. Say no to requests that drain you. If you're in a caregiving role, ensure you have support. There's also a warning against nepotism or favouritism—yours or others'. Merit matters. If you're feeling stuck, reconnect with why you started this work. What brings you joy? Start small. Create something just for you. The Empress reversed reminds you: you can't nurture others from emptiness. Fill your own cup first.",
        "health": "Reversed, the Empress suggests neglecting basic self-care—skipping meals, poor sleep, ignoring your body's need for rest and pleasure. You may be pushing yourself too hard, believing that rest is earned rather than essential. There's also a warning about using food, shopping, or other pleasures to numb rather than nourish. True self-care is consistent, not indulgent. Start with basics: regular meals, hydration, movement you enjoy, adequate sleep. Spiritually, you may have disconnected from nature or your body—living entirely in your head. Reconnect through your senses. Touch, taste, smell, see, hear. You are an embodied being. Honour that."

He holds an ankh sceptre in one hand and a globe in the other—power over life and dominion over the material world. Behind him, barren mountains rise; before him, order prevails. The Emperor is card number four: the first card of established structure. Where the Empress nurtures growth, the Emperor builds the framework that allows it to endure. He represents authority, discipline, and the courage to make difficult decisions. This is a time to take responsibility, set boundaries, and lead—yourself first, then others. Structure is not restriction; it's the foundation that allows freedom to flourish.",
        "love": "The Emperor in love is commitment, stability, and clear communication. If you're single, you may be attracted to someone who embodies these qualities—reliable, protective, decisive. Or you're being asked to embody them yourself: be clear about what you want, set healthy boundaries, don't play games. For those in relationships, this card suggests a phase of solidifying—moving in together, engagement, or simply establishing patterns that create security. The Emperor asks: are you showing up consistently? Are you communicating your needs directly? Love thrives on reliability. Be someone your partner can count on. Also ensure warmth accompanies structure—authority without tenderness becomes coldness.",
        "career": "Professionally, the Emperor is one of the strongest cards for leadership, management, and building lasting institutions. This is a time to take charge, make strategic decisions, and establish systems that others can follow. If you're in a position of authority, lead with clarity and fairness. If you're not yet in leadership, demonstrate that you can handle responsibility—meet deadlines, communicate clearly, own your mistakes. This card also favours negotiations, contracts, and long-term planning. Think in years, not weeks. Build something that outlasts you. The Emperor reminds you: authority is earned through competence and integrity, not demanded through force.",
        "health": "The Emperor governs structure and discipline—excellent for establishing consistent health routines. This is the card of regular sleep schedules, strength training, posture work, and following through on medical advice. If you've been inconsistent with your health, the Emperor asks you to treat it like the responsibility it is. Your body is the foundation of everything you do; care for it accordingly. There's also a warning against rigidity—discipline should serve your wellbeing, not become punishment. Balance structure with flexibility. Spiritually, the Emperor represents grounded faith—beliefs that are lived, not just professed. Practice what you preach. Lead by example.",

You may be controlling—imposing your will on others, refusing to adapt, or using authority to dominate rather than lead. Alternatively, you may lack discipline entirely—avoiding responsibility, making excuses, or refusing to set necessary boundaries. The throne is either a prison or abandoned. Ask yourself: where am I being unnecessarily rigid? Where am I avoiding necessary structure? The Emperor reversed asks you to find balance. Authority without compassion is tyranny; flexibility without boundaries is chaos. Lead yourself with firm kindness. Set limits that protect without punishing.",
        "love": "In relationships, the reversed Emperor can indicate control issues—dictating terms, emotional coldness, or using logic to dismiss feelings (yours or your partner's). There may be power struggles, with neither party willing to yield. Alternatively, you may be dealing with someone who is irresponsible, unreliable, or refuses to commit. If you're single, examine your patterns: are you attracted to controlling partners, or do you become controlling when you feel vulnerable? For those partnered, have honest conversations about power dynamics. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, not domination. If there's any form of abuse—emotional, financial, physical—seek support. You deserve safety.",
        "career": "Career-wise, this reversal warns of micromanagement, bureaucracy, or conflicts with authority. You may be working for someone who is controlling or incompetent, or you may be the one creating problems through rigidity. Re-examine your systems: are they serving the work, or are you serving the systems? If you're in leadership, invite feedback. If you're not, document issues and protect yourself from unreasonable demands. There's also a warning against cutting corners or avoiding responsibility—short-term ease creates long-term problems. Do the work. Meet your commitments. If the environment is toxic, plan your exit strategically. Don't burn bridges; build new ones.",
        "health": "Reversed, the Emperor can indicate health issues related to stress from overwork, or conversely, complete lack of discipline around health habits. You may be pushing yourself too hard, believing rest is weakness, or you may be avoiding necessary medical care. There's also a warning about using control to manage anxiety—rigid diets, excessive exercise, or obsessive health tracking that becomes its own problem. Find balance. Structure should support your wellbeing, not become another source of stress. If you're struggling with authority figures (including doctors), examine why. Trust is earned, but so is openness.

He wears a triple crown and raises two fingers in blessing; before him, two acolytes kneel in learning. The Hierophant is card number five: the bridge between the divine and the human, the keeper of tradition and sacred knowledge. This card represents established systems—religious, educational, cultural—that have endured because they contain truth. The Hierophant asks you to consider what you believe and why. Are your values truly yours, or inherited without examination? This is a time to learn fundamentals, honour commitments, and find wisdom in tradition—while remembering that rules serve people, not the reverse.",
        "love": "In love, the Hierophant often indicates formalising a relationship—engagement, marriage, or making a public commitment. It can also represent relationships that follow traditional patterns or are blessed by family and community. If you're single, this card suggests you may meet someone through established channels—introductions through friends, religious communities, or shared values. For those partnered, the Hierophant asks: do your values align? Are you building something that honours both of your beliefs about commitment, family, and purpose? This is not a card for casual connections—it seeks meaning, longevity, and shared spiritual ground.",

This is a time to learn from mentors, follow proven methods, and earn credentials that validate your expertise. There's wisdom in doing things 'the proper way' when you're building a foundation. This card also supports teaching, training, and roles that involve passing knowledge to others. If you're considering additional education or certification, the timing is favourable. Remember: tradition provides a foundation, but innovation builds upon it. Learn the rules thoroughly before you break them.",
        "health": "The Hierophant supports conventional medical approaches—working with qualified professionals, following established treatment protocols, and trusting evidence-based care. This is not the time for experimental treatments or rejecting medical advice in favour of unproven alternatives. If you're struggling with a health issue, seek expert guidance. This card also governs the mind-body connection through established practices—prayer, meditation, community support. You don't have to walk the path alone. Lean on your community. Share your burden. There's strength in shared faith and collective wisdom. Honour your body as sacred—it's the temple you inhabit.",

        "general": "Reversed, the Hierophant indicates tension with established systems. You may be questioning beliefs you inherited, chafing against rules that no longer serve you, or realising that authority figures don't deserve your automatic respect. This can be healthy rebellion—outgrowing limitations—or it can be rebellion for its own sake, rejecting wisdom along with dogma. The reversed Hierophant asks: what beliefs are you holding because they're comfortable rather than true? What traditions honour you, and which constrain you? You're allowed to forge your own path. Just ensure you're not throwing away wisdom with the rules. Examine. Question. Choose consciously.",
        "love": "In relationships, this reversal can indicate non-traditional arrangements—long-distance, age gaps, cultural differences, or relationships that don't fit family expectations. There may be pressure from family or community to conform to their vision of what your relationship should be. The reversed Hierophant asks: whose life is this? If you're single, you may be attracted to people outside your 'type' or social circle. That's fine—just ensure you're connecting authentically, not rebelling against expectations. For those partnered, have honest conversations about values. Are you together because you share beliefs, or because it's expected? Authenticity matters more than approval.",
        "career": "Career-wise, the reversed Hierophant suggests you've outgrown your current environment—the methods feel outdated, the culture stifling, or the leadership unworthy of your respect. This can be a time of healthy change: starting your own business, switching industries, or finding mentors who align with your values. Alternatively, you may be tempted to reject all structure, believing that rules don't apply to you. They do. The question is which rules serve you. If you're being asked to compromise your ethics, that's not tradition—that's corruption. Trust your judgment. Forge your path. Just remember: even rebels need discipline.",
        "health": "Reversed, this card can indicate rejecting conventional medicine in favour of alternatives—sometimes wisely, sometimes not. If conventional approaches haven't worked for you, exploring other options is reasonable. Just ensure you're not rejecting helpful treatments out of distrust or ideology. Get second opinions. Research thoroughly. Your health is too important for dogma on either side. There's also a warning about health beliefs inherited from family that may not serve you—'we just don't go to doctors' or 'real men don't show weakness.' Examine these beliefs. Choose what serves your wellbeing. You're allowed to break family patterns. Your body deserves evidence-based care."

The angel is Raphael, healer of God, blessing their union. This is card number six: the first card of conscious choice. The Lovers is not merely about romance—it's about alignment. It asks: what do you value? What are you choosing? Every choice is a rejection of other paths; the Lovers asks you to choose with integrity. This card appears when you're facing a decision that will define your direction. Don't choose based on fear, obligation, or short-term pleasure. Choose based on who you want to become. The right choice aligns your actions with your values.",

If you're single, you may meet someone who feels like a mirror, reflecting both your strengths and your growth edges. This isn't just chemistry; it's recognition. For those in relationships, this card suggests a deepening of commitment—possibly engagement, marriage, or a conscious decision to build a future together. The Lovers asks: are you choosing each other daily? Love is not just a feeling; it's a series of choices. Choose kindness. Choose honesty. Choose each other, even when it's difficult.",
        "career": "Professionally, the Lovers favours partnerships, collaborations, and work that aligns with your values. You may be facing a choice between two paths—follow your passion or take the stable job? Stay or leave? The Lovers reminds you: there's no universally right answer, only the answer that's right for you. Consider what matters most. Money? Meaning? Flexibility? Growth? There's no shame in any of these—just be honest about your priorities. This card also supports negotiations and contracts. Ensure terms are fair and mutual. The best partnerships benefit everyone involved. Choose work that doesn't require you to compromise your integrity.",

This card supports practices that integrate mind and body: yoga, tai chi, partner dance, or any activity that requires connection and presence. If you're facing health decisions, consider all options carefully. The right choice aligns with your values and long-term wellbeing, not just short-term relief. This card also reminds you that relationships affect health—supportive connections heal, toxic ones harm. Invest in relationships that nourish you. Set boundaries with those that drain you. You're allowed to choose who you let close. Your wellbeing matters.",

This can show up as inner conflict (wanting two incompatible things), outer conflict (disagreements with others), or simply feeling stuck because you're afraid to choose. The reversed Lovers asks: what are you avoiding? What choice feels difficult because both options have costs? Not choosing is itself a choice—one that often costs more in the long run. Examine your values. What truly matters? Make the choice that honours those values, even if it's difficult. Clarity comes through commitment, not hesitation.",
        "love": "In relationships, the reversed Lovers can indicate disharmony—miscommunication, conflicting values, or choices that have created distance. There may be temptation—yours or your partner's—or a relationship that looks good from the outside but feels wrong from within. If you're single, you may be attracted to someone who isn't available, or you're staying single out of fear rather than choice. For those partnered, have honest conversations about where you're misaligned. Are you both committed to the same vision? Are there unmet needs? The reversed Lovers doesn't mean the relationship is doomed—it means work is needed. Choose each other consciously, or choose to part with respect.",
        "career": "Career-wise, this reversal warns of choices made from fear or external pressure rather than authentic desire. You may have taken a job for the money that drains your soul, or stayed in a role too long out of comfort. Alternatively, you may be facing a difficult decision and paralysed by fear of choosing wrong. There is no perfect choice—only the choice you make and the commitment you bring to it. If you're in a partnership that isn't working, address it directly. Unclear agreements create resentment. If you're considering leaving, plan strategically. Don't burn bridges; build new ones. Choose with intention, then commit fully.",
        "health": "Reversed, the Lovers can indicate inner conflict manifesting physically—stress from competing priorities, guilt about self-care, or health choices that don't align with your values. You may know what you should do but keep choosing differently. Examine why. Is it fear? Convenience? People-pleasing? There's also a warning about relationships affecting health—staying in stressful dynamics, isolating when you need support, or neglecting health to care for others. You can't pour from an empty cup. Make choices that honour your wellbeing. Seek support. You don't have to navigate this alone. Choose health. Choose harmony. Choose yourself."

The warrior wears a crown and armour, holding a sceptre but no reins. Control comes not from force but from will. Behind the chariot, a walled city represents the security left behind; ahead, open terrain symbolises the journey. The Chariot is card number seven: the first card of triumph through effort. This is victory earned through discipline, focus, and the courage to move forward despite competing pulls. You have a destination. Hold your course. The Chariot reminds you: momentum requires direction. Choose where you're going, then steer with conviction.",

If you're single, this card encourages you to be direct about your interest. Confidence is attractive; clarity is magnetic. For those in relationships, the Chariot indicates working together toward shared goals—moving in together, planning a future, or navigating challenges as a team. This card also warns against turning love into conquest. You're not trying to 'win' your partner; you're building something together. Channel your determination into creating connection, not control. Victory in love is mutual.",

This card favours activities that require focus and determination: martial arts, competitive sports, or any practice that builds both body and will. There's also a warning: don't let determination become obsession. Rest is part of training. Listen to your body. Pushing through injury serves no one.

This can show up as aggression (forcing outcomes), avoidance (refusing to engage), or simply exhaustion from trying to control everything. The sphinxes pull in different directions; the chariot goes nowhere. The reversed Chariot asks: what are you avoiding? Where are you forcing rather than flowing? Sometimes the answer is to stop—to rest, reassess, and choose a new direction. Other times, it's to simplify—focus on one goal instead of ten. You can't control everything. Choose what matters. Let go of the rest.",
        "love": "In relationships, the reversed Chariot can indicate power struggles—both parties trying to control the direction, or one person driving while the other resists. There may be aggression, defensiveness, or simply exhaustion from constant conflict. If you're single, you may be pursuing someone who isn't interested, or you're so focused on finding a partner that you're missing connections right in front of you. For those partnered, ask: are you working together, or against each other? Relationships aren't battles to be won. Sometimes the bravest thing is to stop pushing and start listening. Choose connection over control. Victory isn't being right; it's being together.",
        "career": "Career-wise, this reversal warns of burnout from overwork, or projects that have lost direction. You may be trying to do too much, competing in arenas that don't matter, or pushing forward out of stubbornness rather than strategy. Step back. Reassess. Is this goal still worth pursuing? Are there obstacles that require a different approach? There's no shame in changing direction—it's often wiser than persisting blindly. If you're facing setbacks, examine what you can control and what you can't. Focus your energy accordingly. Sometimes the victory is knowing when to retreat. Live to fight another day. Choose your battles wisely.",

Your body is not a machine—it needs rest, recovery, and compassion. If you've been driving yourself relentlessly, this card asks you to slow down.

This is not the strength of domination—it's the strength of integration. You don't defeat your fears; you befriend them. You don't suppress your emotions; you channel them.

When conflict arises, lead with curiosity, not defensiveness. This card also supports working through difficult conversations—infidelity, trust issues, or major life changes. The lion can be fierce, but gentleness disarms. Love requires courage. Be brave enough to be tender.",

You may be doubting yourself, feeling overwhelmed by emotions, or lashing out from a place of fear rather than confidence. Alternatively, you may be suppressing emotions so thoroughly that they're erupting unexpectedly. The lion is either caged or running wild. The reversed Strength asks: where are you being hard on yourself? Where are you avoiding difficult feelings? True strength includes vulnerability. It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to ask for help.

For those partnered, have honest conversations about what you're feeling. Vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the pathway to genuine connection. If you're struggling, seek support.

This is a time of withdrawal—not from fear, but for clarity. The Hermit knows that truth isn't found in noise but in silence. You're being asked to step back from the world and listen to your inner voice. What do you truly believe? What do you truly want? The answers won't come from others. They come from within. Solitude isn't loneliness; it's the space where wisdom grows. Trust the process. Your light will guide you.",

If you're in a relationship, the Hermit may indicate needing space for individual growth. This isn't rejection; it's self-care. Healthy relationships require two whole people, not two halves making a whole. Communicate your need for space clearly. A secure partner will understand.

The reversed Hermit asks: are you withdrawing for the right reasons? Is this solitude serving you, or are you hiding? There's a difference between choosing silence and being trapped in it.

What can you control? Focus there. There's also a warning about resisting necessary change—staying in a dying industry, refusing to learn new skills, or clinging to a role that no longer fits. The wheel is turning. Adapt or be left behind. If you're facing difficulties, remember: this is temporary. Cycles end. New ones begin. Use this time to prepare. Update your skills. Network. Plan.

Bad periods don't mean you're not healing overall. Trust the larger arc. Work with your healthcare providers. Adapt your approach. The wheel will turn. Prepare your body and mind for when it does.

Justice asks you to act with integrity, knowing that your choices have consequences. This is a time of clarity—seeing situations as they are, not as you wish them to be.

If you've been wronged, seek appropriate recourse, but don't let bitterness consume you. If you've wronged others, make amends. Accountability isn't punishment; it's the pathway to freedom.

For those partnered, have honest conversations about where the relationship feels imbalanced. Are both parties contributing? Are agreements being honoured?

The Hanged Man chooses to hang—to see the world from a different angle, to release control, to trust the process. This card appears when you're stuck, not because you're failing, but because you're being asked to let go. What are you holding too tightly? What perspective shift is needed? Sometimes the only way forward is to stop. Surrender isn't defeat; it's wisdom. Trust the pause.",

This card also supports sacrifice for long-term gain—taking a pay cut for meaningful work, stepping back to upskill, or leaving a stable job for something that aligns with your values.

What's falling apart in your life? A relationship, a job, a belief system? The Tower asks you to trust the destruction. What's being destroyed wasn't meant to last. The lightning is divine intervention—truth breaking through illusion. This isn't punishment; it's liberation. The foundations were false. Better they fall now than later. Let it burn.

Staying out of fear serves no one. Have the difficult conversation. End what needs ending. If you're single, you may be avoiding vulnerability, building walls to prevent future pain.
